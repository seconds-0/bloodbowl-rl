## Current verdict

The obs-v6 / exact-action lineage has its first reproducible scoring policy:
two independent rung-6 backplay runs (maxdist 6, reset 0.5, `s0_both`,
genesis pool `f6a6323a`, 5B steps) finished clean in July at tds 0.299 /
0.303 per episode from curriculum starts, all sixteen hard-integrity counters
zero in both phases, curves plateaued from ~2.6B on. Neither could advance the
ladder because the bare rung launcher never published eligible lineage
(D235). No production reward or default has changed; `s0_both` remains the
experimental lineage reward.

## Kickoff exam (D50) — chain2 checkpoint, 2026-08-18

Full games from kickoff, frozen, torch: vs contact bot AWAY champion **0.052** TD/g / bot 1.281 (2,017 g); vs contact bot HOME champion **0.035** / bot 1.276 (2,003 g); mirror self-play 0.951 TD/g total, possession 0.199, blocks 9.2 (human 2.2 / 0.475 / 80). Verdict D241: scores from kickoff vs itself, not under scripted contact pressure → graduation rungs need a scripted-opponent share.

Watch: `~/bin/vwatch`. Rig watch: `~/bin/bbwatch`. Cross-host moves use
`checkpoint_lineage.py rehost` (D238).

## Next after the chain

1. Kickoff graduation (reset 0.25 → 0) and the D50 exam: full-game
   tournament from kickoff vs the genesis pool + scripted contact bot
   (`tools/eval_vs_contact_bot.sh` after `training/convert_checkpoint.py`).
2. Second seed of the whole chain (seed 42) for a replicate before any claim.
3. Then the reward program resumes on a policy that can score from kickoff:
   the possession/gain decomposition (D229/D233) is uninterpretable on
   scoreless policies.

## Replay and BC state

Unchanged since 2026-07-13: 9,118 strict BB2025 replays / 1,622,231 joined
records; corpus is opening-censored; replay-first sampling is the default.

## Verification and deployment state

Rig checkout `/home/rache/bloodbowl-rl-qualification-candidate-10619e2` at
`8ecf8a6` (clean `--float` rebuild, drift check OK, genesis root and pool
re-validated against the rebuilt module). BBTV production checkout untouched.
Vast credit is exhausted (balance −$2.96); the 2070 is the only trainer.
